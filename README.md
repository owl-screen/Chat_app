⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/owl-screen/Chat_app.git
cd Chat_app

2. Run the Backend
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run


Backend starts on http://localhost:8080

3. Open the Frontend

Open the index.html file from the frontend/ folder in your web browser.
You can connect multiple browser tabs or devices to test real-time messaging.

🧩 How It Works

When a user sends a message, the frontend sends it through a WebSocket connection.

The Spring Boot server receives and broadcasts the message to all connected clients.

Each connected client instantly displays the new message — no page reload required.
